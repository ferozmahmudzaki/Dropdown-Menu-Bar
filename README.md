# Dropdown-Menu-Bar
Hey friends, today in this blog you’ll learn how to create a Responsive Dropdown Menu Bar or Dropdown Menu using HTML and CSS only. In the earlier blog, I have shared how to create Sidebar Menu using HTML & CSS only and now it’s time to create a responsive dropdown menu.
 
I’m sure that you know what is the dropdown menu and you may have seen it on different websites. A dropdown menu is a list of links or items that appears whenever the user clicks or hovers on it. Nowadays every website has a responsive navbar with a dropdown because with the help of dropdown we can easily organize listing by category and it is compulsory now for every website for the user conveniences.

In our Responsive Dropdown Menu Bar, as you can see in the preview image, there is a horizontal navbar with a dropdown. At first, the drop menu or submenu are hidden but when you hover on the particular nav link then the dropdown menu appears on the hovered link. There is visible a pretty cool box-shadow effect when you hover on the particular nav link.

This is a fully responsive navbar with a dropdown menu and it is created using only HTML & CSS. On the pc, this navbar is displayed horizontally but on mobile devices, this dropdown or navbar displayed vertically like a mobile menu. On mobile devices, you have to click on the nav link to show the dropdown menu but on pc, you have to hover.
